 AI MINI PC with Touch screen + keyboard (laptop shaped) + Compact power bank



## Solving power problem 

Make you select a mini pc that supports ubc c power and use a power bank for off grid power https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6H-CyOy5d4, may use case to club them and or tape them together, just kidding.

Anker power banks can be used to power mini PCs, provided the power bank has sufficient power output and the mini PC supports USB-C Power Delivery (PD). Many mini PCs, like the Minisforum UM790 Pro, are designed to be powered via USB-C, making them compatible with power banks that offer USB-C PD. The Anker 737 power bank, for example, can deliver 100 watts of USB-C PD power, which is sufficient for many mini PCs. 

## Advantages

The built-in AMD Ryzen AI engine also contributes to its AI processing capabilities
